# typescript-phaser3-template

I was looking for a TypeScript Game Engine / Framework to make some game prototypes. Phaser 3 seems to be a good fit, but I wasn't happy with the example boilerplate with vanilla JS in `.html` files. Found a few TypeScript examples and distilled it down to a barebones tempate project that I can use as a starting point for game projects.

## Highlights of this setup
* Phaser 3
* TypeScript
* ESLint + Prettier
* webpack + webpack-dev-server
* yarn

## Usage
```
yarn install
yarn dev  (or yarn build)
```
This will launch webpack-dev-server then compile, bundle, and start the game.
